Whole crop gets demolished due to a spark of fire, Excessive watering can lead to serious problem of soil erosion.

The main Aim of the system is to save crop which is Golden and ready to harvest from various disasters like, Fire, Animals, Birds, Climate change, Excessive water etc.The System will send alert to farmer in case there are excessive birds, fire, animals in their farm and small robotic mechanism to keep birds away from crop. 

In this, we developed a hardware product as well as API using MQTT protocol. we are using DHT11 (Temperature, Humidity), Fire sensor,IR sensor, MQ2 and Soil moisture sensor etc. and Raspberry pi 3.
